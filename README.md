# XeroGen
This project aims to bring a more stable and user friendly Chat GPT interface designed to allow others to implement their own GPT prompt generators if they want. It is primarily designed to work with the ultimate stable diffusion prompt generator created by Xerophayze.  You can purchase Xerophayze's prompt generator at https://shop.xerophayze.com and you can see it in action on his youtube channel https://video.xerophayze.com.
